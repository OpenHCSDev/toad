# Initial message publication

Prepared conversation Markdown now acquires its original body worker during
mount, while the body message pump observes completion after mounting. Native
Markdown keeps its default complete-document mount promise (Textual #116).
There is no copied readiness state or new queue.

Source range acquisition joins the actual part publications. Viewport paging
honors its existing native frame receipt before choosing another source edge;
preview extents cannot repeatedly admit the remainder of the message.

The first matched run exposed excessive admission: 23 mounted parts, 568
widgets. Joining part workers alone did not solve it. After the frame receipt
correction, the run mounted four parts, 224 widgets; posting took 8.4 ms and an
actual App callback ran 0.73 ms later while preparation was pending. Preparation
still took 2.88 seconds. These are single source-App measurements, not physical
frame pacing or installed/live claims.

The existing paged nested-Markdown App control passed in 13.98 seconds:
posting 3.56 ms, body readiness 2.08 seconds, nested text and links, original
source copying, native scrolling/reversal, retirement and warm paint identity.
The redundant second update of the constructor's source was removed.

Raw measurements: `/home/ts/.cache/agent-scratch/dm-mount-frame-profile-20261008`.
App result: `/home/ts/.cache/agent-scratch/dm-mount-source-20261008`.
Earlier excessive-admission runs remain in `dm-mount-profile-20261008` and
`dm-mount-acquisition-profile-20261008`; none were overwritten.

Publication and installed acceptance follow through the existing frontend
publication owner. The backend and active native agent sessions are separate.

The candidate build passed all installed asset, origin and RECORD checks, but
the installed paged control timed out retiring the older body. The first source
run passed; this installed negative is not dismissed. Its receipt records a
LiveBody with 23 parts. A subsequent narrowed source run also failed, with no
viewport worker pending and a PresentedFrame with no deferred callbacks. The
frame wait now applies only to range admission, so it does not block retirement;
the remaining exposure/reader relation still needs its actual geometry trace.
The candidate is unpublished and the previous launch default is unchanged.
Raw failures remain in `dm-mount-installed-20261008` and
`dm-mount-retirement-source-20261008` under the owned scratch directory.
The added geometry trace (`dm-mount-geometry-source-20261008`) confirms the old
body is actually offscreen and not interaction-protected. The reader is at the
native bottom with follow intent, no anchor, no viewport worker and no deferred
frame callback. Retirement acquisition, rather than mistaken exposure or a
still-pending frame, is the remaining investigation.
